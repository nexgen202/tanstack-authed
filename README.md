## Getting Started

We're using **pnpm** by default, but you can modify the scripts in [package.json](./package.json) to use your preferred package manager.

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=react-tanstarter&template_owner=dotnize) or clone this repository with gitpick:

   ```bash
   npx gitpick thecodingmontana/tanstack-authed myapp
   cd myapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

4. Push the schema to your database with drizzle-kit:

   ```bash
   pnpm db push
   ```

   <https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/migrations>

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Goodies

These scripts in [package.json](./package.json#L5) use **pnpm** by default, but you can modify them to use your preferred package manager.

- **`db`** - Run drizzle-kit commands. (e.g. `pnpm db generate` to generate a migration)
- **`ui`** - The shadcn/ui CLI. (e.g. `pnpm ui add button` to add the button component)
- **`format`**, **`lint`**, **`check-types`** - Run Prettier, ESLint, and check TypeScript types respectively.
  - **`check`** - Run all three above. (e.g. `pnpm check`)
- **`deps`** - Selectively upgrade dependencies via taze.
